Changes made to the schema:

#1. We removed the Time_Period table because it was redundant with what we had in Rental_Due_On.

#2. We added a branch_id attribute to the Has_Books table to be able to express that different branches could have books with the same ISBN number.

#3. We added a branch_id attribute to the Book_Copy table because it has a foreign key constraint on (see #2).

#4. We added a branch_id attribute to the Rental_Due_On table because it has a foreign key constraint on (see #2).

#5. We added a branch_id attribute to the Reservation_For table because it has a foreign key constraint (see #2).

#6. We removed the Modifies table because it was found to be unnecessary in expressing the required functionality.

#7. We removed the Reserved_On table because it was found to be unnecessary in expressing the required functionality.
